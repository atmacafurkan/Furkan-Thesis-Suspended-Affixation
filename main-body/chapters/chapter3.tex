In this chapter, my aim is to come up with experiment designs where I investigate if SA is reserved for inflectional paradigm, if conjoiner choice has an effect on SA with varying amounts of SA, and responses of language users to SA and its environment in different settings. I lay out the experiment designs in the following sections. The first two experiments are exploratory and probe different conditions in SA to get more information about it. In the last experiment, I try to model SA and test in what modes it operates. I compare the modes and the theoretical approaches in an effort to better inform the analysis of SA.
