In this chapter I am going to lay out designs for three experiments each investigating different aspects of SA. The first experiment is an acceptability study that deals with whether or not SA of derivational suffixes is possible in Turkish. The second experiment is a self paced reading study that deals with whether or not a relation exists between the amount of SA and the resolution of SA. The third experiment is a picture selection task that deals with whether or not string-wise constituent size differences affect SA.
