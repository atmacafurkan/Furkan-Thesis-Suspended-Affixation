\cite{geoffrey1967turkish} is credited with the term SA and first observations of it in Turkish. Categorized as an agglutinating language with many inflectional and derivational functions represented by distinct morphemes, Turkish has many affixes that can be suspended, both in nominal and verbal domains. Some papers that exclusively examine SA in Turkish are: \cite{orgun1995flat}, \cite{kabak2007turkish}, \cite{broadwell2008turkish}, \cite{kornfilt2012revisiting}, and \cite{kharytonava2012word,kharytonava2012taming}. In the following sections I give the summaries of these papers relating to SA in Turkish.

Other papers investigating SA in other languages are: \cite{erschler2012suspended}, and \cite{erschler2018suspended} for Ossetic, \cite{yoon2017lexical} for Korean, \cite{despic2017suspended} for Serbian, and \cite{guseva2017postsyntactic} for Mari, \cite{pounder2006broken} for German. These papers range from giving the relative data and its limitations to the structural accounts and predictions for SA. In the following subsections I provide a short summary of papers dealing with Turkish, their data and analysis.

\section{SA in other languages}

While the focus and effort of this study is limited to SA in Turkish, it is beneficial to take observations from other languages where similar SA-like phenomena exist. In the following subsections I provide summaries of such papers in a chronological order. \cite{pounder2006broken} shows examples of SA and conjunction reduction from German, \cite{guseva2017postsyntactic} shows examples of SA from Mari, \cite{despic2017suspended} shows an example of a certain Serbian clitic that mimics SA-like behaviour, \cite{yoon2017lexical} shows examples from Korean, and \cite{erschler2012suspended,erschler2018suspended} show examples from Ossetic.
