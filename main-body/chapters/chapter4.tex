\chapter{\MakeUppercase{suspended affixation and sentence processing}}

The previous chapter focused on SA and its environment. The results of the first experiment showed that SA is mostly reserved for inflectional suffixes and changes in the environment of SA affects its acceptability. The second experiment showed that performing SA has a non-additive cost that differs from an effect of conjuncts with mismatching features.

In this chapter my aim is to investigate how SA would interact with sentence processing. I first give the structural explanations for SA. I then present a structural ambiguity environment dependent on SA. I come up with an experiment design using the ambiguity environment and come up with hypotheses for the results. I end the chapter by reporting on the experiment results and analysis.
