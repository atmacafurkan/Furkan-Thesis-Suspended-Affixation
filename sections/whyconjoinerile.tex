\section{Why \textit{ile/=lA} is a conjoiner}

While \textit{ile} allows for insertion of the Plural and the Possessive suffixes before itself and allows for SA of them, it does not allow the insertion of {\Acc}. However it still distributes the case over to the first conjunct thereby we have SA. By this observation we need to add another type of configuration for SA where we have a selective process that allows only for the insertion of some elided parts. An argument that could be made against such an approach would be to posit that \textit{ile} itself behaves like a case marker and that's why insertion of {\Acc} is not allowed. However this line of approach would have problems outside of SA to begin with. A verb that assigns lexical case, \textit{kork} `to fear', and \textit{başla} for example can have arguments that are conjoined with \textit{ile} (\ref{ilelex}).

\begin{exe}
    \ex \label{ilelex}
    \begin{xlist}
    \ex 
    \gll 
    \textit{Kedi=yle} \textit{köpek-ten} \textit{kork-uyor-um} \\ cat={\And} dog-{\Abl} fear-{\Prog}-{\First}.{\Sg} \\
    \glt `I am scared of the cat and the dog.'
    
    \ex 
    \gll 
    \textit{Sigara=yla} \textit{alkol-e} \textit{başla-dı-m.} \\ cigarette={\And} alcohol-{\Dat} start-{\Pst}-{\First}.{\Sg} \\
    \glt `I started to use cigarette and alcohol.'
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

If we were to assume that \textit{ile} itself is a case marker, than the lexical case assigning \textit{kork} `to fear', and \textit{başla} `to start' would select an argument that are not case marked to their selection of Ablative and Dative. A further claim could be to assume that \textit{ile} itself is not a conjoiner and is just a case marker that is assigned by a zero conjoiner head (Figure \ref{fig:zeroconjoiner}).

\begin{figure}[hbt!]

    \begin{forest}

        [BP 
            [DP

            [B, name=conj]]

            [D]]]

    \end{forest}

\end{figure}

This way the only case that is assigned by the lexical case assigning verbs fall to the second conjunct. However contemplating that \textit{ile} is a case suffix that is assigned by a zero conjoiner head would result in problems for SA (\ref{ileSA}).
\begin{exe}
    \ex \label{ileSA}
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex 
        \gll 
        \textit{Kalem=le} \textit{kitab-ım-ı} \textit{bul-du-m.} \\ pencil={\And} book-{\Poss}.{\First}.{\Sg}-{\Acc} find-{\Pst}-{\First}.{\Sg} \\
        \glt `I found my pencil and my book.'
    
        \ex
        \gll 
        \textit{Kalem=le} \textit{kitap-lar-ım-ı} \textit{bul-du-m.} \\ pencil={\And} book-{\Pl}-{\Poss}.{\First}.{\Sg} find-{\Pst}-{\First}.{\Sg} \\
        \glt `I found my pencils and my books'
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The examples in (\ref{ileSA}) would violate the rightward bound nature of SA, since {\Poss} and {\Pl} suffixes before \textit{ile} would be subject to suspension but not \textit{ile} itself. Such configurations would have the templatic views in (\ref{ileSAtemplatic}, morphemes inside [] are suspended)

\begin{exe}
    \ex \label{ileSAtemplatic} 
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex NP-[{\Poss}]-{\Case} conjoiner NP-{\Poss}-{\Case}
        \ex NP-[{\Pl}-{\Poss}]-{\Case} conjoiner NP-{\Pl}-{\Poss}-{\Case}
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Stemming from the observations we made in (\ref{ilelex}) and (\ref{ileSA}), \textit{ile} itself is a conjoiner head and not a case suffix. Additionally, the phrase that \textit{ile} conjoins is not case markable, yet it can be marked for number and possession. The final representation for \textit{ile} as a conjoiner, following \cite{ozturk2016possessive} in positing a small "n" head responsible for number and agreement marking, is given in Figure \ref{fig:ile}.
