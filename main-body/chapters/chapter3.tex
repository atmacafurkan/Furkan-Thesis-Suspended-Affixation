\chapter{\MakeUppercase{Exploratory Studies in SA}}

In this chapter I present 2 exploratory studies that investigate different aspects of SA. One aspect is whether or not derivational suffixes can take part in SA, another aspect is whether or not conjoiner has an effect in SA, and the last one is whether the amount of SA causes increased processing difficulty in local environments.
