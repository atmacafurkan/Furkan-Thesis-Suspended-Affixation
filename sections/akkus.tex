Akkuş provides some examples for SA in derivational suffixes. He argues that the existence of such examples are not numerous but they are also not that rare. For some of the examples see (\ref{akkusder}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{akkusder}
\begin{xlist}
    \ex \gll ... yedi ve yirmi-nci bölüm-ler ... \\ ... seven {\And} twenty-{\Der} episode-{\Pl} \\
    \glt `... seventh and twentieth episodes ...'
    
    \ex \gll ... beş lira ve on dolar-lık banknot-lar ... \\ ... five lira {\And} ten dollar-{\Der} banknote-{\Pl} ... \\
    \glt `[five lira and ten dollar] worth banknotes'
    
    \ex \gll ... Deprem ve Afet-zede An-ma Yürü-yüş-ü ... \\ ... earthquake {\And} disaster-{\Der} remember-{\Nmlz} walk-{\Nmlz}-{\Acc} ... \\ 
    \glt `[Earthquake and Disaster] Victims Remembrance March'
    
    \ex \gll ... dost ve arkadaş-ça bir hava ... \\ ... fellow {\And} friend-{\Der} {\Det} air ... \\
    \glt Lit:`a [friend and fellow]-like armosphere' \\ Mean: `a friendly and amiable atmosphere'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Akkuş argues that a natural coordination explanation \citep{walchli2005co} provided in \cite{kabak2007turkish} falls short of explaining instances of derivational SA. Reiterating examples from \cite{ackema2004beyond, lieber2006lexical}, Akkuş points to two options for explaining derivational SA. First is what is provided in \cite{lieber2006lexical}, which suggests that morphology has access to the output of syntax. Second is what is provided in \cite{ackema2004beyond}, which suggests three modules in language, namely syntax, semantics, and phonology, that can have interactions with one another. Both the approaches would allow for morphological elements to have complex bases for derivation or inflection.
