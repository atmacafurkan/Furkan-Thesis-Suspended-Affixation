Akkuş provides some examples for SA in derivational suffixes. He argues that the existence of such examples is not numerous but not that rare. Her provides some examples like (\ref{akkusder}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{akkusder}
\begin{xlist}
    \ex \gll \ldots yedi ve yirmi-nci bölüm-ler \ldots \\ 
    \ldots seven {\And} twenty-{\Der} episode-{\Pl} \ldots \\
    \glt `\ldots seventh and twentieth episodes \ldots'
    
    \ex \gll \ldots beş lira ve on dolar-lık banknot-lar \ldots \\
    \ldots five lira {\And} ten dollar-{\Der} banknote-{\Pl} \ldots \\
    \glt `[five lira and ten dollar] worth banknotes'
    
    \ex \gll \ldots Deprem ve Afet-zede An-ma Yürü-yüş-ü \ldots \\ \ldots earthquake {\And} disaster-{\Der} remember-{\Nmlz} walk-{\Nmlz}-{\Acc} \ldots \\ 
    \glt `[Earthquake and Disaster] Victims Remembrance March'
    
    \ex \gll \ldots dost ve arkadaş-ça bir hava \ldots \\ \ldots fellow {\And} friend-{\Der} {\Det} air \ldots \\
    \glt Lit:`a [friend and fellow]-like armosphere' \\ Mean: `a friendly and amiable atmosphere'\\*

Akkuş argues that a natural coordination explanation \citep{walchli2005co} provided in \cite{kabak2007turkish} falls short of explaining instances of derivational SA. Akkuş reiterates examples from \cite{ackema2004beyond, lieber2006lexical} and points to two options for explaining derivational SA. First is what is provided in \cite{lieber2006lexical}, which suggests that morphology has access to the output of syntax. Second is what is provided in \cite{ackema2004beyond}, which suggests three modules in language, namely syntax, semantics, and phonology, that can have interactions with one another placing morphology within syntax. Both the approaches would allow for morphological elements to have complex bases for derivation or inflection.
